Human pose estimation is a computer vision technique used to detect and predict the positions of key body joints (e.g., wrists, elbows, shoulders, hips, knees, ankles) in an image or video. The output is typically represented as a skeletal model overlayed on the person's image, showing the spatial arrangement of the detected joints.
